Withdrawal symptoms when the football season finished have also been reported. The economy can also be seen to be connected to major football tournaments, although the precise association is disputed. The terms \"soccer mom\" and \"soccer dad\", popularised in the United States, refer broadly to a demographic group of parents with school-age children playing football. Visual arts Football has not been widely represented in fine art. Sunderland and Aston Villa were the subject of one of the earliest football paintings in the world â possibly the earliest â when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted Sunderland v. Aston Villa 1895 (also titled A corner_kick). This canvas depicts a game between the two most successful English teams of the decade at Sunderland's then ground Newcastle Road. A 1908 oil painting by Henri Rousseau bears the title The Football Players, but it is possible that the moustachioed players depicted in this picture are, in fact, playing an early form of rugby football. Kazimir Malevich's created an abstract painting in 1909 entitled Painterly Realism of a Football Player â Color Masses in the 4th Dimension. Another abstract football work, Dynamism of a Soccer Player by Umberto Boccioni dates from 1913. In the post-war era, Nicolas de StaÃ«l produced a series of paintings depicting a floodlit football match played between France and Sweden in 1952, entitled Les Footballeurs. \nCosine Similarity Score: 0.7254\n\nTop 3 relevant documents based on BM25 keyword search:\nDocument: Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands British schools Games still played at UK public (private) schools: Eton field game Eton wall game Rugby football Harrow football Winchester College football Tabletop games, video games, and other recreations Based on association football Blow football Button football â also known as Futebol de Mesa, Jogo de BotÃµes Fantasy football FIFA Video Games Series Lego Football Mario Strikers Penny football Pro Evolution Soccer Subbuteo Table football â also known as foosball, table soccer, babyfoot, bar football or gettone Based on American football Blood Bowl Fantasy football (American) Madden NFL Paper football Based on Australian football AFL video game series List of AFL video games Based on rugby league football Australian Rugby League Sidhe's Rugby League series Rugby League 3 \nKeyword Match Score: 8.0176\n\nDocument: Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands British schools Games still played at UK public (private) schools: Eton field game Eton wall game Rugby football Harrow football Winchester College football Tabletop games, video games, and other recreations Based on association football Blow football Button football â also known as Futebol de Mesa, Jogo de BotÃµes Fantasy football FIFA Video Games Series Lego Football Mario Strikers Penny football Pro Evolution Soccer Subbuteo Table football â also known as foosball, table soccer, babyfoot, bar football or gettone Based on American football Blood Bowl Fantasy football (American) Madden NFL Paper football Based on Australian football AFL video game series List of AFL video games Based on rugby league football Australian Rugby League Sidhe's Rugby League series Rugby League 3 \nKeyword Match Score: 8.0176\n\nDocument: strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\").

a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport. Association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68â70 cm (27â28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that only within the penalty area.

Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Corner kicks and other crosses At corner kicks, and at direct free_kick, indirect free_kick or throw-ins that are likely to distribute a cross, most teams use man-on-man marking, even those which otherwise play zone defence. Each player is given an opponent to mark, in advanced football they usually have been assigned an opponent before the match. Substituting at the time of a defensive set piece is regarded as unwise, as play may be started before the substitute has come into marking position. A few teams use the tactic of gathering defenders on one line on corner kicks and similar situations, in effect giving them the responsibility for zones instead of particular opponents. Penalty kicks In the case of a penalty_kick, no defending players except the goalkeeper are allowed within the penalty area or within ten yards of the penalty spot and 18 yards of the goal line. A significant number of players should, however, be placed right outside the penalty area, alert to advance into the area and clear any deflection. For this purpose, sometimes the attacking team will nominate two players to run at the goal from either side of the penalty spot; timing their run so that\n\nDocument 3 (Score: 0.031754032258064516):\nor behind the goal line (equivalent to the goal-kick). Teams changed ends every time a goal was scored. The rules made no provision for a goal-keeper, match officials, punishments for infringements of the rules, duration of the match, half-time, number of players, or pitch-markings (other than flags to mark the boundary of the playing area). At its meeting on 8 December 1863, the FA agreed that, as reported in Bell's Life in London, John Lillywhite would publish the Laws. The first game to be played under the new rules occurred eleven days later between Barnes and Richmond. Adoption of the laws was not universal among English football clubs. The Sheffield Rules continued to be used by many. Additionally, in preference for hacking as well as handling of the ball, several clubs, such as Blackheath, decided against being part of the FA in its early years and would later form the Rugby Football Union in 1871.

Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word football is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries). So, effectively, what the word football means usually depends on where one says it. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as football, while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, football historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football amÃ©ricain and association football is known as le soccer.

Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\". The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free_kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball. The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes.

In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and NCAA still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws. Players, equipment, and officials Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws. The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards.

Wing-back The wing-back (or attacking full-back) are defenders with heavier emphasis on attack. The name is a portmanteau of \"winger\" and \"full-back\", indicating the greater emphasis on their responsibilities in attack. They are usually employed as part of a 3â5â2 formation, and can therefore be considered part of the midfield when a team is attacking. They may also be used in a 5â3â2 formation and therefore have a more defensive role. The term \"wing-back\" itself is gradually falling out of use as there is less of a distinction with the full-back roles in the modern game, especially when used in a 4â3â3 or 4â2â3â1 formation. The wing-back role is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football. Wing-backs are often more adventurous than traditional full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and then defend effectively against an opponent's attack down the flanks.

The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010â11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".

Paralympic football â modified game for athletes with a disability.\n\nSummary 3: In some areas it is referred to as \"AFL\", the name of the main organising body and competition Auskick â a version of Australian rules designed by the AFL for young children Metro footy (or Metro rules footy) is a modified version invented by the USAFL, for use on gridiron fields in North American cities. Kick-to-kick is a more open, running variety of Australian Rules, requiring 18 players in total and a proportionally smaller playing area.\n\nSummary 4: Keepie uppie (keep up) is the art of juggling with a football using the feet, knees, chest, shoulders, and head. Speedball is a combination of American football, soccer, and basketball, devised in the United States in 1912. Universal football is a hybrid of Australian rules and rugby league, trialled in Sydney in 1933. Volata is a game resembling association football and European handball, devised by Italian fascist leader, Augusto Turati, in the 1920s. Wheelchair rugby is based on ice hockey and basketball rather than rugby.\n\nSummary 5: Rugby football split into Rugby union, Rugby league, American football, and Canadian football. First international match between the national team of England and Scotland took place at Raeburn Place on 27 March 1871. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football. Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of the Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.\n\nSummary 6: Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.\n\nSummary 7:  association football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport. The game is played with a football that is 68â70 cm (27â28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line)\n\nSummary 8: The first published rules of \"football\" were those of Rugby School (1845), which permitted extensive handling. Between the 1830s and 1850s, a number of sets of rules were created for use at Cambridge University. By the time the Football Association met in late 1863, many different rules had been published, varying widely on such questions as the extent to which the ball could be handled. Sheffield F.C. (written 1858, published 1859) and Melbourne FC (1859) are the origins of Australian rules football.\n\nSummary 9: Wills Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free_kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs.\n\nSummary 10: The word football is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as football. In New Zealand, football historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to referring to association football. The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity. In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is called le football.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":59},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Summarization function (optional), uses Facebook Bart to summarize the retrieved documents to remove noise from documents before they are passed on to the text generation model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Construct the RAG prompt for a single query input and its resulting output\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are an AI assistant tasked with answering questions based on retrieved knowledge.\n\n### **Retrieved Information**:\n1. {summarized_responses[0]}\n\n2. {summarized_responses[1]}\n\n3. {summarized_responses[2]}\n\n4. {summarized_responses[3]}\n\n5. {summarized_responses[4]}\n\n6. {summarized_responses[5]}\n\n7. {summarized_responses[6]}\n\n8. {summarized_responses[7]}\n\n9. {summarized_responses[8]}\n\n10. {summarized_responses[9]}\n\n### **Question**:\n{question}\n\n### **Instructions**:\n- Integrate the key points from all retrieved responses into a **cohesive, well-structured answer**.\n- If the responses are **contradictory**, mention the different perspectives.\n- If none of the retrieved responses contain relevant information, reply:\n  **\"I couldn't find a good response to your query in the database.\"**\n\"\"\"\n\n# Generate response using Qwen2.5\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\noutput = generator(messages)\nprint(textwrap.fill(output[0][\"generated_text\"], width=80))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T15:08:28.534365Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T15:08:28.534699Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T15:08:57.875378Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T15:08:28.534669Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T15:08:57.874467Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"To answer your question about the main rules of football or soccer and the\ndefinitions of goal-kicks and corner-kicks, let's integrate the key points from\nthe provided information:  In football or soccer, the primary objective is to\nscore goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal (between the\nposts, under the crossbar, and fully across the goal line). The game is played\nwith a spherical ball that is typically 68-70 cm in circumference.   The game is\nplayed between two teams of 11 players each. Players can kick the ball, pass it\nto teammates, and use their feet, legs, chest, shoulders, and head to control\nthe ball. However, the ball cannot be carried by any player, except for the\ngoalkeeper within their penalty area.  Some common skills include passing,\ntackling, evasion of tackles, catching, and kicking. In all codes, there are\nrestrictions on players moving offside, and players scoring a goal must put the\nball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.  Regarding specific\nkicks: - **Goal-Kick**: This is a type of indirect free kick taken by the\ndefending team when the ball last crossed the touchline while in play and was\nlast touched by an attacking team member. The ball must be kicked out of the\npenalty area and cannot be deliberately re-passed to a teammate. - **Corner-\nKick**: This is a type of direct free kick taken by the attacking team when the\nball crosses the goal line and was last touched by a defending team member. The\nball must be kicked from the corner arc and cannot be deliberately re-passed to\na teammate.  It's important to note that the exact rules regarding goal-kicks\nand corner-kicks can vary slightly depending on the specific code of football\nbeing played, such as association football, rugby football, or others. However,\nthe general principles outlined above apply to association football, which is\nthe most widely recognized form of football globally.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":60},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"RAG prompt for a single query as an input, to compare with that generated by multiple query inputs down below","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Rag prompt function which instead takes all the generated queries as inputs aswell as their relevant documents\n\n# Function to generate the RAG prompt and get the response\ndef generate_rag_response(queries, summarized_responses, generator):\n    # Initialize the prompt\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an AI assistant tasked with answering questions based on retrieved knowledge.\n\n    ### **Retrieved Information**:\n    1. {summarized_responses[0]}\n    2. {summarized_responses[1]}\n    3. {summarized_responses[2]}\n    4. {summarized_responses[3]}\n    5. {summarized_responses[4]}\n    6. {summarized_responses[5]}\n    7. {summarized_responses[6]}\n    8. {summarized_responses[7]}\n    9. {summarized_responses[8]}\n    10. {summarized_responses[9]}\n\n    ### **Question**:\n    {queries[0]}  # Original query\n\n    ### **Generated Queries**:\n    1. {queries[1]}  # Generated query 1\n    2. {queries[2]}  # Generated query 2\n    3. {queries[3]}  # Generated query 3\n    4. {queries[4]}  # Generated query 4\n    5. {queries[5]}  # Generated query 5\n\n    ### **Instructions**:\n    - Integrate the key points from all retrieved responses into a **cohesive, well-structured answer**.\n    - If the responses are **contradictory**, mention the different perspectives.\n    - If none of the retrieved responses contain relevant information, reply:\n      **\"I couldn't find a good response to your query in the database.\"**\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Generate response using the RAG model (Qwen2.5 or other)\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n    output = generator(messages)\n    \n    # Print the generated response, wrapped for readability\n    return textwrap.fill(output[0][\"generated_text\"], width=80)\n\n# Example queries and summarized responses\nqueries = [question, qs1, qs2, qs3, qs4, qs5]  # Including original and generated queries\n\n# Get the RAG response from the generator\nrag_response = generate_rag_response(queries, summarized_responses, generator)\n\n# Print the final generated answer\nprint(rag_response)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T14:48:13.980593Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T14:48:13.980905Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T14:48:43.300754Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T14:48:13.980882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T14:48:43.299984Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The main rules of football or soccer include:  1.
