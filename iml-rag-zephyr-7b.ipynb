The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport. Association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68â70 cm (27â28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that only within the penalty area.

Common rules among the sports include: Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular. A clearly defined area in which to play the game. Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line. Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts. The goal or line being defended by the opposing team. Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks. In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.

Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football. These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as \"football codes\". There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football. The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.

The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team.

The game is played with a football that is 68â70 cm (27â28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used.

Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word football is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries). So, effectively, what the word football means usually depends on where one says it. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as football, while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, football historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line).

Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.

The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010â11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".

Wing-back The wing-back (or attacking full-back) are defenders with heavier emphasis on attack. The name is a portmanteau of \"winger\" and \"full-back\", indicating the greater emphasis on their responsibilities in attack. They are usually employed as part of a 3â5â2 formation, and can therefore be considered part of the midfield when a team is attacking. They may also be used in a 5â3â2 formation and therefore have a more defensive role. The term \"wing-back\" itself is gradually falling out of use as there is less of a distinction with the full-back roles in the modern game, especially when used in a 4â3â3 or 4â2â3â1 formation. The wing-back role is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football. Wing-backs are often more adventurous than traditional full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and then defend effectively against an opponent's attack down the flanks. A defensive midfielder is usually fielded to cover the advances of an opponent's wing-back. Midfielder Midfielders (originally called half-backs) are players whose position of play is midway between the attacking forwards and the defenders. Their main duties are\n\nDocument 10 (Score: 0.016129032258064516):\nit has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Corner kicks and other crosses At corner kicks, and at direct free_kick, indirect free_kick or throw-ins that are likely to distribute a cross, most teams use man-on-man marking, even those which otherwise play zone defence. Each player is given an opponent to mark, in advanced football they usually have been assigned an opponent before the match. Substituting at the time of a defensive set piece is regarded as unwise, as play may be started before the substitute has come into marking position. A few teams use the tactic of gathering defenders on one line on corner kicks and similar situations, in effect giving them the responsibility for zones instead of particular opponents. Penalty kicks In the case of a penalty_kick, no defending players except the goalkeeper are allowed within the penalty area or within ten yards of the penalty spot and 18 yards of the goal line. A significant number of players should, however, be placed right outside the penalty area, alert to advance into the area and clear any deflection. For this purpose, sometimes the attacking team will nominate two players to run at the goal from either side of the penalty spot; timing their run so that\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Document retrieval for 5 prompt engineered queries (optional) which resemble the original query, retrieves 5 documents per query (original + 5 generated) and uses RRF to discover the top 10 retrieved queries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load a summarization pipeline\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"facebook/bart-large-cnn\")\n\n# Summarize each retrieved document\nsummarized_responses = []\nfor doc in top_10_documents: # use retrieved_documents if you want to avoid using the generated prompts, top_10_documents for generated prompts\n    try:\n        summary = summarizer(doc, max_length=250, min_length=100, do_sample=False)[0][\"summary_text\"]\n        summarized_responses.append(summary)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error summarizing document: {e}\")\n        summarized_responses.append(doc)  # fallback to original doc if summarization fails\n        \n# Print the summarized responses\nfor i, summary in enumerate(summarized_responses):\n    print(f\"Summary {i + 1}: {summary}\\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T16:05:27.554161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T16:05:27.554532Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T16:05:44.571047Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T16:05:27.554496Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T16:05:44.569947Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Device set to use cuda:0\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"Summary 1:  association football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport. The game is played with a football that is 68â70 cm (27â28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line)\n\nSummary 2: In 2019, goals scored by hand, whether accidental or not, are disallowed. Attacking players can no longer interfere in defensive walls during free kicks. Substituted players have to leave the field at the nearest goal line or touchline instead of walking to their technical area. During penalties, goalkeepers are only required to keep one foot on the line. In 2023, \"Kicks from the penalty mark\" renamed to \"Penalties (penalty shoot-out)\". Cautions in regulation play & extra_time are no longer carried forward into a penalty_shootout.\n\nSummary 3: The word football is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as football. In New Zealand, football historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to referring to association football. The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity. In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is called le football.\n\nSummary 4: In some areas it is referred to as \"AFL\", the name of the main organising body and competition Auskick â a version of Australian rules designed by the AFL for young children Metro footy (or Metro rules footy) is a modified version invented by the USAFL, for use on gridiron fields in North American cities. Kick-to-kick is a more open, running variety of Australian Rules, requiring 18 players in total and a proportionally smaller playing area.\n\nSummary 5: The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB. Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.\n\nSummary 6: North America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning the most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women's game has been improving in South America. Gameplay Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nSummary 7: Bridgewater study found clubs sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match. University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Transfer regulations and foreign players Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.\n\nSummary 8:  association football, also known as football, soccer, footy and footie. These codes have in common the prohibition of the use of hands (by all players except the goalkeeper, though outfield players can \"throw-in\" the ball when it goes out of play), unlike other codes where carrying or handling the ball by all players is allowed. Includes: Football 5-a-side for visually impaired athletes. Paralympic football â modified game for athletes with a disability.\n\nSummary 9: Wing-back (or attacking full-back) are defenders with heavier emphasis on attack. The name is a portmanteau of \"winger\" and \"full-back\", indicating the greater emphasis on their responsibilities in attack. Wing-backs are often more adventurous than traditional full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A defensive midfielder is usually fielded to cover the advances of an opponent's wing-back. Midfielders (originally called half-backs) are players whose position of play is midway between the attacking forwards and the defenders.\n\nSummary 10: Most teams use man-on-man marking, even those which otherwise play zone defence.
